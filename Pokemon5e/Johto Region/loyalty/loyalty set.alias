In addition, before activating a move, must roll higher than a 10 on a d20 roll or the move fails.', 'Upset Pokémon hold a small grudge against their trainers that affects them in battle. Pokémon at this level add -1 to any saving throw they make.', 'A neutral Pokémon acts normally with no stat modifiers. It responds to its trainers commands and acts on its own accord outside of combat as an Active Pokémon.

Pokémon at this level gain the same saving throw bonus as the "Content" level. In addition, they increase their maximum HP by half their level (rounded up) and gain one skill proficiency of their choice. (Animal Handling may not be chosen. In the case where a Pokémon would dip below this Loyalty and come back, the same skill must be selected. If a Pokémon would evolve and gain an identical skill naturally, it may choose a different proficiency at that time.)', 'Pokémon at this level have an incredible bond with their trainers, willing to risk their own life for their trainer\'s safety. Pokémon at this level gain the same saving throw bonus and chosen skill proficiency as the "Pleased" level. In addition, their maximum HP increase becomes equal to their level, and they gain "expertise" in a single existing skill proficiency of their choice.
